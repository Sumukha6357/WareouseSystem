# 📖 Logistics Ledger: Simple User Guide

Welcome to the **Logistics Ledger**! This guide explains what you can do with the system in plain English. No technical jargon here.

## 🏢 1. Warehouse Overview
The dashboard gives you a bird's-eye view of your stock levels. You can see how much space is left and where your items are stored across different "Blocks" (sections) of the warehouse.

## 📦 2. Managing Items (Products)
Think of this as your digital catalog.
- **Register Items**: Add new products with their name, SKU (barcode ID), and weight.
- **Track Quantity**: See exactly how many units are sitting in each section.

## 📝 3. Order Processing
When a customer wants something, an "Order" is created.
- **Pick Tasks**: The system tells staff exactly which shelf to go to and how many items to grab.
- **Fulfillment**: Once items are picked and packed, you can mark the order as shipped.

## 🚚 4. Shipment Tracking
Keep an eye on what's leaving the building. You can manage shipping partners (Shippers) and see the status of every outgoing package.

## 📊 5. Activity Feed
The "Logistics Ledger" is a live history of every single move. If an item is moved from Shelf A to Shelf B, it's recorded here so you always know who moved what and when.
